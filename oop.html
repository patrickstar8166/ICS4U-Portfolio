        <h3>What is OOP?</h3>
        <p>OOP, or object oriented programming, is a way of coding using objects. Like physical objects, they have properties and behaviour and are useful to model real-life situations</p>

        <h3><br>What is an Object?</h3>
        <p>Characteristics of real-life objects </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Made of tangible material</li>
            <li>Has properties</li>
            <li>Can do things and can have things done to it</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="underline">Example:</p>
        <img src="images/pen.jpg" style="height:30%; width:30%;">
        <p class="caption">An example of a real life object is a pen. It is made of tangible materials (ex. metal, plastic), has properties (ex. black, blue ink, metal tip), and can do things/can have things done to it (ex. write, hold it).</p>
        <p>Characteristics of software objects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity: Occupies a designated chunk of memory</li>
            <li>State: The variables (properties) which may change</li>
            <li>Behaviour: The methods that enable the object to perform things</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><br>What is a Class?</h3>
        <p>A class is a description of a type of object, or a template. It realizes the identity, state, and behaviour of an object. To use a class, one must first create an object. Objects of a class have all attributes and behaviour (variables and methods) of that class, but the attributes may differ. A class is inheriently a data structure (Ex. Integer). Class names always start with a capital letter.</p>
        <p class="underline">Example:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
public class Pen{
    private String material;
    private String colour;

    public void write(){
        //write using pen
    }

    public void holdPen(){
        //hold the pen
    }
}
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3><br>Constructors</h3>
        <p>A constructor is what is used to create an object. A constructor always has the same name as the class, and is often used with values, called parameters to allow for customization. This is called overloading. However, all constructors of a class create the same type of object. The only difference is that they have different attributes. Note that when an object of a class without a constructor is created, Java will provide a default (no parameter) constructor.</p>
        <p class="underline">Example:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
public class Pen{
    private String material;
    private String colour;

    public Pen(){
        material = "steel";
        colour = "black";
    }

    //customization of Pen
    public Pen(String penMat, String penCol){
        material = penMat;
        colour = penCol;
    }
    
    //all other methods not implemented
}
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3><br>Static vs. Instance Methods</h3>
        <p>Static methods are methods that belong to the class definition. They are not part of objects when an object is created, and thus there is only one of that method. Static methods can be run without creating an object of the class.</p>
        <p>Instance methods exist only when they are part of on object. Thus, an object needs to be created before they can be executed.</p>

        <h3><br>Accessing Variables and Methods</h3>
        <p>The variables and methods of an object are said to be the members of that object. These members can be accessed with dot notation. However, an object of the class needs to first be created. To do so, use the <span class="textCode">new</span> keyword and the specified parameters. Once an object is created, any public members can be accessed.</p>
        <p class="underline">Example:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
//in a class other than Pen
Pen p1 = new Pen(); //default pen
Pen p2 = new Pen("plastic", "blue"); //specific pen
p1.write();
p2.hold();
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3><br>Programming Style</h3>
        <p>Everything in a Java program is brought together in the main or driver method, which contains the main method. The public keyword allows other classes to access methods in that class, while the private keyword doesnâ€™t allow access to the method/variable in that class.</p>
