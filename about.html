    <div class="text" style="font-size:1.7em;">
        <p><img src="images/star.jpg" style="float:right; width:25%; height:25%;">Hi! My name is Patrick Bian and I am a Grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI. I am mainly a C++ programmer, but I am also efficient in HTML/CSS/JS and Java. Here is my <a style="color:white" href="https://dmoj.ca/user/patrickstar8166" target="_blank">DMOJ account</a> and my <a style="color:white" href="https://github.com/patrickstar8166" target="_blank">Github account</a>.</p>
        
        <h2><br>My Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, coding, math, and playing badminton. I started playing piano ever since I was 5 years old, and have been playing since. I recently got my ARCT diploma this past summer, the highest academic level in piano. I also do a lot of math outside of school, taking extracurricular classes and writing math contests. I also volunteer with a math organization to help kids in their mathematics journey. In addition to these, I also enjoy playing sports, especially badminton and basketball.</p>

        <h2><br>My Journey of Coding</h2>
        <p>I started coding in Grade 9 with the ICS2DP course. This prompted me to learn more about computer science, and got into competitive programming at the start of Grade 10. I taught myself C++ using websites like Geeks for Geeks and lessons from our school coding club, MCPT. I achieved a lot in three short months. By the start of December 2022, I was able to do 12 pointers on DMOJ and had a blue rating. <a style="color:white" href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18s3" target="_blank">This</a> is one of my favourite problems. 
        <br><br>I recently started learning about web development, and I am a part of Metropolis, the school website. I taught myself the basics of HTML/CSS/JS in a week and made a small game, which is linked below. I recommend those starting out with web development to visit sites like <a style="color:white" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>.</p>

        <h2><br>My Future</h2>
        <p>I have a keen interest in technology. In the future, I would like to pursue a career in AI and machine learning. With this in mind, I hope to be able to learn more about AI, and eventually make my own in the next two years of my high school career. I also enjoy business and I am a part of our school's DECA chapter. I also hope to be able to integrate business into my university life in the future.</p>
