        <h3><br>Time Complexity</h3>
        <p>Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of input. It does not measure the total execution time of an algorithm, but gives information about the change in execution time when the number of operations changes.<br><br>The most common form is Big O Notation. The run time of an algorithm in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input by defining the operations done on it. The notation is O[n], where O is the order of growth and n is the length of the input.<br><br>Common time complexities:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Constant time - O(1): Not dependent on the input size n; runtime is always the same</li>
            <li>Linear time - O(n): Running time increases linearly with the length of input</li>
            <li>Logarithmic time - O(log n): When the algorithm reduces the size of the input data in each step</li>
            <li>Quadratic time - O(n^2): When the running time increases by a square with the length of the input</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><br>Sequential Search</h3>
        <p>Searching is used for finding an element in a list. Sequential search scans the list and compares the target value to each element, until the target is found or the whole list is searched. It is the most basic searching algorithm and has a time complexity of O(n).</p>

        <p style="text-decoration:underline;">Implementation:</p>
        
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
//search for the number 5 in the list {1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 5}
int[] list = {1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 5};
int target = 5;
for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++){
    if (list[i] == target) 
        System.out.println("Found it!");
}
            </pre>
